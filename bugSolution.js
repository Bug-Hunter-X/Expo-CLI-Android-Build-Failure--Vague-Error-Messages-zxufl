Solutions to resolve vague Expo CLI Android build errors often involve a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Update Android SDK and Build Tools:**
   - Use the Android SDK Manager to ensure you have the latest SDK platform-tools, build-tools, and Android SDK build-tools.

2. **Clean the project:**
   -  In your project's directory, delete the `android` and `node_modules` folders. 
   - Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`. This forces a clean build process. 

3. **Verify Gradle Settings:**
   - Ensure the `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file contains the recommended Gradle version.
   - Check `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` for any configuration errors.

4. **Examine the Full Build Log:**
   - The full build output contains more details than the summary.  Examine the complete log file to find more specific clues. 
   - It's often helpful to search the logs for keywords relating to the symptoms (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, `ClassNotFoundException`).

5. **Build using Android Studio:**
   - Open the `android` folder in Android Studio to utilize its debugging and build capabilities.  Android Studio provides more detailed build logs and error messages. 

By systematically investigating these areas, you increase the chance of identifying the underlying cause of the vague error.
