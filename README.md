# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Vague Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue when building Android apps with Expo CLI: encountering vague error messages during the build process. The build often hangs or fails without providing specific details about the problem, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The primary problem is the lack of informative error messages from the Expo CLI Android build process. Errors often relate to Gradle, Android SDK versions, or missing dependencies.  The `build` command might hang indefinitely or return a generic failure message.

## Solution

This repository contains steps to address this issue. The proposed solution focuses on improving diagnostics by:

1. **Checking Android SDK and build tools versions:** Ensuring these components are up-to-date and compatible.
2. **Cleaning the project:** Removing build artifacts to force a fresh build.
3. **Verifying Gradle settings:** Ensuring the Gradle version is correct and the project configuration is sound. 
4. **Examining the full build log:**  Analyzing the complete log file for more detailed clues.
5. **Using a more detailed build process:** For advanced debugging, consider building via Android Studio.
