This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android build process.  The error message itself can be vague, but often points to problems with Gradle, Android SDK versions, or missing dependencies.  A common symptom is the build process hanging or failing without clear indication of the root cause. For example:
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong: ...
```
The specific error message will vary but often lacks detailed information, making debugging difficult.
